Graphyyyyyyyy : 
This project is a graphical interface for plotting mathematical functions, calculating derivatives, and integrating functions over a specified interval. Inspired by tools like Desmos, it is built using Python with libraries like matplotlib, sympy, and tkinter . 
-Features : 
*Plot Multiple Functions: Enter multiple mathematical expressions to visualize their plots.
*Customize Styles: Change the color and line style of the plots dynamically.
*Derivative Calculation: Compute and display derivatives of functions up to the 5th order.
*Integration Support: Calculate and display the integrals (primitives) of functions.
-Interactive UI:
*Pan and zoom on the graph.
*Enable/disable derivative and integral overlays with checkboxes.
*Error Handling: Alerts users to any syntax or input errors.
****Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
-Python 3.x
-matplotlib
-sympy
-numpy
You can install the necessary libraries using: 
"pip install matplotlib sympy numpy"
#How to Run : 
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/theblackhatcomes/Graphy.git  
cd Graphy
2. run the script : python app.py
3. Usage
Input Functions: Enter one or more mathematical expressions in the text area (one per line).
Supported operations: sin, cos, tan, exp, sqrt, log, sinh, cosh, tanh, and basic arithmetic.
Use Pythonic notation (e.g., x**2 for x^2).
Define Range: Set the interval [A, B] for x  .
Customize Appearance: Select line style and color from dropdown menus.
Compute Derivatives and Integrals: Enable options via checkboxes to visualize derivatives and primitives.
Display Graph: Click "Afficher" to generate the plot.

#Future Improvements : 
-Add support for 3D plotting.
-Enhance error messages for unsupported functions or invalid inputs.
-Save plotted graphs as image files.
